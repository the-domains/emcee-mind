I quote Rakim when I take a long break from the work of Emcee Mind. Regardless, I'm sorry I left you without dope rhyming tips to develop your craft. Hopefully, you checked out the videos on Youtube.com/emceemind.

Anyway, Emcee Mind is back for the summer with new approaches to helping you develop rap skills.
